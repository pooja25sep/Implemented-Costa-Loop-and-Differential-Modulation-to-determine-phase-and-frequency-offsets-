# Implemented-Costa-Loop-and-Differential-Modulation-to-determine-phase-and-frequency-offsets

* Carried out investigation and comparison of Impact of phase and frequency offset on a signal for
Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) & 8-Phase Shift Keying (PSK) Modulation schemes.
* Analysed the results post implementation of differential modulation scheme for BPSK & QPSK.
* Implemented Viterbi-Viterbi algorithm to estimate frequency offsets and used Costa Loop for achieving
carrier frequency & phase synchronization.
